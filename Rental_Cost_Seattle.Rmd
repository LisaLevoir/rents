```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Rents")
zillow <- read_csv("Neighborhood_MedianRentalPrice_Studio.csv")
# this is a data set I downloaded from Zillow that contains the median rental price by neighborhood for what appears to be major metropolitan areas
zillow_seattle <- filter(zillow$City, )
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
